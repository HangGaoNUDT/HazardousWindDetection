# HazardousWindDetection

## Description
The cluster network consists of the encoded layers within a stacked autoencoder (SAE)  and an additional linear layer based on the encoded features.
This package contains the parameter-initializing, training, evaluating and feature-space visualizing process of the cluster network, as well as the data required for network training.

Please note that the entire dataset used for the training and test  are available from the corresponding
author upon reasonable request. 

The "ClustrNN" folder contains the procedures of data import, model establish, and results display.
