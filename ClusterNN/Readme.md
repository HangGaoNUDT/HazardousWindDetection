The model is established in the "ClusterNN.py";
"ClusterNN_without_linear_layer.py" is a model where the additional linear layer has been neglected.
"_seasonal_occurrence_prob.ipynb" shows the seasonal characteristics obtained from the 21-year pilot reports and the hazard factor, respectively. The correlation coefficient is obtained.
A comparative analysis is conducted in the "Comparison" folder, where the detection performance of this model, CatB, IForest, and XGOB are compared.
